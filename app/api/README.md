# API Layer

## Purpose
FastAPI endpoint definitions and request/response handling for all system operations.

## Goals
- RESTful API design following OpenAPI standards
- Proper HTTP(S) status codes and error responses
- Authentication and authorization enforcement
- Responsive and Fast API endpoints for interacting with the hardware and configuration

## Structure
- Router organization by functional domain
- Dependency injection for services and auth
- Middleware for logging and security
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time data

## Requirements
- Authentication Flows and Role-Based endpoint protection
- OAuth2 with Password(and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens
- Comprehensive input validation
- Rate limiting on control endpoints
- Structured error responses
- API documentation generation

## Constraints
- All hardware operations must be non blocking (Must not interfere with the main hardware processing loop of data collection, processing and analysis)
- Safe I2C operations and considerations for reliability and consistency
- Security-first approach for all endpoints
- Performance optimization for IoT hardware
- Role Based enpoint authentication
- Endpoints for all hardware operations and sensor data (controlling I/O's, retriving sensor data, sensor data websockets)
