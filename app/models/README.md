# Data Models

## Purpose
Pydantic models for validation, configuration schemas, and internal data structures.

## Goals
- Type safety throughout the application
- Input validation with custom validators
- Consistent data serialization/deserialization
- API documentation generation

## Categories
- Request/Response models for API endpoints
- Configuration models with validation
- Hardware state and metrics models
- Database models for persistence
- System Level Configuration models with validation - Such as network settings

## Requirements
- Strict validation rules for hardware constraints
- Validators for I2C addresses and pin names based on custom hardware
- Strict validation rules for system settings
- Comprehensive field documentation
- Validation for all the configurations: app\config\README.md

## Constraints
- Performance impact of validation
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Hardware-specific validation rules
- Security considerations for sensitive data
