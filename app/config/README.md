# Configuration Management

## Purpose
Hierarchical configuration system with validation, hot-reload, and runtime modification capabilities.

## Goals
- File based configuration with runtime overrides and configuration
- Secrets separation from main configuration
- Schema validation and conflict detection
- Atomic updates with rollback support (Maybe use SQLite)

## Components
- Configuration models with Pydantic validation
- File-based persistence for easy/replicable distrobution
- Runtime override management
- Environment-specific overlays

## Requirements
- Hot-reload without service restart
- Hardware address conflict detection
- Configuration change detection (Changes must be applied and in effect immediatly)
- API endpoints for modifications

## Constraints
- Thread-safe configuration access
- Validation of all hardware configurations
- Backup/Default configuration recovery mechanisms
- Security controls on configuration changes
