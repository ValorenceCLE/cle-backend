# FastAPI Backend Application Overview

## Purpose
FastAPI backend for IoT device management system controlling I/O channels and process/analyze sensor data via I2C hardware on Orange Pi Zero 3.

## Core Goals
- Real-time I/O control via API endpoints
- Power monitoring and environmental sensing
- GPS location tracking and data collection
- Configuration-driven hardware management
- Web-based control interface

## Architecture
- FastAPI with async request handling
- I2C & UART hardware abstraction layer
- Configuration File based architecture
- Time-series data collection to database
- OAuth2 with Password(and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens

## Key Requirements
- Real-Time or Near Real-Time Monitoring of all I/O's and Sensors
- Hardware fault tolerance and recovery
- Security hardening for field deployment
- Hot-reload configuration without restart
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- API endpoints for interacting with hardware (I/O reading/control, Historical Sensor Data, Real-Time sensor data), Authentication, Device Control and Configuration File Management
- Lightweight Architecture and footprint optimized for IoT devices
  
## Constraints
- I2C sequential access limitation
- Orange Pi Zero 3 hardware resources
- Field deployment reliability needs
- Real-Time performance requirements
